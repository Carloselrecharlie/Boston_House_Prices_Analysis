## Getting started
### Installing
Since I have used packages like *scipy*, *keras* and *Jupyter* I recommend you to install *Anaconda* to make sure that you will be able of running the code without any kind of issues. If you needed it, you can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
This repository is Public so its' available to download and execute.


## Content
Using a Jupyter Notebook I analyze the Boston House Prices dataset. It is made up of three sections, first I __describe__ the Boston House Prices with descriptive statistics and plots, then I __analyse__ whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. And finally I create a neural network that can __predict__ the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.
